// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

import variable 1
import variable 2
variable 1 + variable 2 = variable 3
print variable 3



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

import variable 1

if variable 1 = 1 then print Odd
if variable 1 = 2 then print Even
if variable 1 = 3 then print Odd
if variable 1 is greater than 3 then the square root of variable 1 = variable 2
variable 2 with whole number removed = variable 3
if variable 3 is greater than 0 then print Odd
if variable 3 is = to 0 then print even




// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

read var 1
read var 2
read var 3
read var 4
read var 5

add variables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
divide by 5 = var 6
print var 6

set var 7 =0
if user input is < var 7 then make user input var 7
loop 5 times
print var 7 + is the smallest number

set var 7 =0
if user input is > var 7 then make user input var 7
loop 5 times
print var 7 + is the largest number
